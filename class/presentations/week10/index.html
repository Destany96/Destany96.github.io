    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>
      The monochromatic colour palette created a unified yet calm mood because all of the colours are similar. The triad colour palette provided the most interesting layout because the colours were all different. This also provided a lot of energy on the webpage which I think is perfect for a game website. The analogous colour scheme also provided a fair amount of energy to the page however it also made certain aspects of the page stand out. The colours complimented each other and created a subtle energetic feel.
